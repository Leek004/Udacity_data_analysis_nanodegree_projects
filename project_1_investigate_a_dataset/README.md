# TMDB Dataset Investigation

## Project Overview
This project involves an in-depth investigation of the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset, which contains information about movies, including popularity, budget, revenue, cast, and crew details. The objective is to analyze the data to uncover interesting insights and trends, and to showcase various data analysis techniques expected of a data analyst role candidate.

## Objectives
- Understand the structure of the TMDB dataset.
- Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights.
- Visualize the findings using appropriate charts and graphs.
- Document the entire analysis process and present the conclusions.

## Dataset Description
The TMDB dataset contains several key features:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each movie.
- `title`: Title of the movie.
- `budget`: Budget of the movie in USD.
- `revenue`: Revenue generated by the movie in USD.
- `popularity`: Popularity score of the movie.
- `release_date`: Release date of the movie.
- `vote_average`: Average rating of the movie.
- `vote_count`: Number of votes the movie received.
- `genres`: Genres of the movie.
- `cast`: Main cast of the movie.
- `crew`: Crew involved in the movie, including directors and writers.

## Skills and Techniques Demonstrated

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and managed missing values in critical columns to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Converted columns to appropriate data types, such as dates and numeric values.
- **Data Normalization**: Normalized budget and revenue columns to account for discrepancies.
- **Dropping unwanted columns** : Dropped the budget and revenue columns that have not been corrected for inflation , and dropped other columns that were irrelevant for the analysis.
- **Creating new columns**: Created a profit (and profit rank) columns from the adjusted revenue and budget columns.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation for numeric columns to understand data distribution.
- **Data Visualization**: Used histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to visualize data trends and relationships.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzed correlations between different numerical features to identify potential predictive relationships.

### Data Visualization
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Utilized these libraries to create visually appealing and informative charts.
- **Plotly**: Created interactive visualizations for a more engaging presentation of findings.

### Insights and Conclusions
- **Genre Popularity**: Analyzed which genres are most popular and profitable.
- **Budget vs. Revenue**: Investigated the relationship between budget and revenue to determine if higher budgets lead to higher revenues.
- **Release Date Trends**: Studied the impact of release dates on movie success.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Essential library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Libraries for static data visualization.
- **Plotly**: Library for creating interactive visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for writing and running code, and documenting the analysis process.

## Conclusion
At the end of the project, i was a able to provide a visualized answer to these questions about the dataset:
- what percentage of movies in the dataset made a profit ?
- how much is the total profit and total loss made by all movies in the dataset
- total profit to total loss ratio
- Which decade has the highest number of profitable movies?
- How has the total profit, loss and budget changed over the decades
- Which set of production companies column produced the most movies in the dataset ?
- what production companies made the most profit in each decade
- what Is the correlation between a movie's popularity rating and its profit, and how has popularity rating increased over the decades ?
I also described the limitations in the dataset and how it affected the analysis

This project was part of the capstone project i had to complete as part of the Udacity Data analysis Nanodegree. The TMDB dataset was provided by udacity.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the analysis as needed. Your feedback and contributions are welcome!
