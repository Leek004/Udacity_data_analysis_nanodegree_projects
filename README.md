# Udacity_data_analysis_nanodegree_projects
  This repo contains the 3 projects i worked on as part of the data analysis nanodegree i took on Udacity. All 3 projects were completed via udacity's cloud based project workspace environment which allowed me to add to my experience of managing and working on projects in the cloud. The projects were part of the nanodegree course work and were reviewed by udacity.
  
## Information about each projects
### **Project 1** Investigating a Dataset
  For this project i picked the tmdb movie dataset from the compiled list of datasets provided in the classroom, assessed it, cleaned it, analyses id and answered a couple questions about the dataset with my analysis 
  
### **Project 2** Data Wrangling
  This project focused on my data wrangling skills. Three datasets were programmatically gathered  about a twitter page that rates dogs. 
  The first dataset, an archive of the page's tweets was provided for direct download in the classroom, the second dataset was a tweet json that was  programmatically downloaded from the classroom and was used to extract a dataset containing more information about each rating in the archive and the third is an image prediction table for each rating which was also programmatically downloaded. Some of the packages used durin this process are: `OS`, `json` and `requests`.
  These datsets were then assessed and tidiness/ dirtiness issues were cleaned using the define-code-test method which left me with a master table that was later used for my analysis. some of the packages used for wrangling and analysis are `pandas` for tasks like data manipulation, dataframe slicing, merging, dropping/ renaming columns; `numpy` also for data manipulation; `matplotlib`/`seaborn` for visualization.
  
### **Project 3** Data Visualization
  This roject focused on developing my visualization skills using a loan listings dataset provided by Udacity. It was the most intense of all as i was introduced to a lot of different visualization tips and tricks and i also created a detailed report of the process.  
  All files for each project has been uploaded in seperate folders in this repository.
