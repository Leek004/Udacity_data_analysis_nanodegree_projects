# Udacity_data_analysis_nanodegree_projects<br/>
This repository contains the 3 projects i worked on as part of the data analysis nanodegree i took on Udacity. <br/>
All 3 projects were completed via udacity's cloud based notebook which added to my experience of managing and working on projects in the cloud. <br/> 
The projects were part of the nanodegree course work and were reviewed by udacity's instructors. <br/>
  
## Information about each projects<br/>
### **Project 1** Investigating a Dataset <br/>
For this project i picked the TMDB movie dataset from the compiled list of datasets provided in the classroom, assessed it, cleaned it, analyzed it and answered a couple of questions about the dataset with my analysis <br/>

### **Project 2** Data Wrangling <br/>
This project focused on data wrangling.<br/> 
Three raw datasets were gathered about a twitter page that rates dog pictures. <br/><br/>

DATA INGESTION STEPS:<br/>
  The first dataset - An archive of the page's tweets, was provided for direct download in the classroom.<br/> 
  The second dataset was a JSON file containing tweets data, that was programmatically downloaded from a url. From it a datafame was extracted, containing extra information about each rating in the tweets archive dataset. <br/>
  The third dataset is a table containing prediction of the dog breed every the image in the ratings dataset. It was also programmatically downloaded. 
  Some of the packages used during this data ingestion process are: `OS`, `json` and `requests`.<br/><br/>

DATA CLEANING AND REPORTING<br/>
  These datsets were then assessed and tidiness/ dirtiness issues were cleaned using the **define-code-test methodology**. At the end, this process left me with a final table that was later used for my analysis. <br/>
  Some of the packages used in this step are `pandas` for tasks like data manipulation, dataframe slicing, merging, dropping/ renaming columns; `numpy` also for data manipulation; `matplotlib`/`seaborn` for visualization.<br/><br/>



### **Project 3** Data Visualization <br/>
This project focused on data visualization with python using a 'loan listings' dataset provided by Udacity. <br/>
It was the most intense of all as i was introduced to a lot of different visualization tips and tricks and i also created a detailed report of the process.  <br/>
Each project's files has been uploaded as seperate folders in this repository.
